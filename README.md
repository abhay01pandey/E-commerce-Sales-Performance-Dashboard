# E-commerce Sales Performance Dashboard
This project features an E-commerce Sales Dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive, quarterly view of sales, profitability, and customer behavior for an online retail platform. The core business goal is to identify trends in profit and sales volume to optimize inventory, marketing spend, and supply chain logistics.

Key Metrics Tracked:

Total Amount (Sales): 438K

Total Quantity Sold: 5,615

Total Profit: 36.96K

Average Order Value (AOV): 121K

# Dataset & Tools Used
Dataset:

The analysis utilizes transactional data from the MADHAV ECOMMERCE platform, containing details on sales amount, quantity, profit, customer names, state, payment modes, and product categories.

Tools:

Power BI: Used for the full process: data cleaning and transformation in Power Query, establishing a data model, creating DAX measures (like AOV), and designing the final interactive dashboard.

# Workflow
The dashboard development followed a robust BI process focused on clear, actionable data segmentation:

Data Ingestion & Cleaning: Raw sales data was imported into Power BI. Power Query was used to ensure data types were correctly formatted and to handle any missing values
.
Metric Calculation (DAX): Measures for core KPIs (Total Amount, Profit, AOV) were defined using DAX.

Visualization & Segmentation: Visuals were built to segment performance across four key dimensions:

Geographic: Sales amount by State (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh).

Product: Quantity by Category (Clothing, Electronics, Furniture).

Customer: Sales amount by Top Customer Name.

Time: Monthly profit trend analysis.

Interactivity: Filters for Quarter (Qtr 1-4) and State were implemented to allow dynamic drilling into the data.

# Dashboard Insights
The analysis highlights key areas of business performance:

Profit Volatility: Profit demonstrates significant seasonal variability, peaking strongly in the first quarter (Jan-Mar) before experiencing a sharp drop and operating at a loss during the mid-year months (June-September).

Geographic Concentration: Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are the top-performing states by sales amount, indicating high customer activity in these regions.

Product Performance: Clothing is the dominant category, driving 63% of the total quantity sold, followed by Electronics (21%).

Sub-Category Drivers: Printers and Bookcases are the most profitable sub-categories, warranting focused investment and marketing efforts.

Payment Preference: COD (44%) remains the preferred payment method, followed by UPI (21%), suggesting a trust-based consumer base.

# Results or Conclusion
The dashboard successfully translated raw sales data into actionable business intelligence. The most critical finding is the severe mid-year profit dip, which suggests potential issues with inventory management, marketing strategy, or costs during that period.

The platform should leverage the high-profit sub-categories (Printers, Bookcases) and reinforce its marketing efforts in the high-demand states to stabilize and increase year-round profitability.
